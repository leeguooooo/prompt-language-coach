## v0.9.0 - 2026-04-17

### Fixes
- Stop flooding the Codex transcript with coaching instructions every turn.
  Codex renders `UserPromptSubmit` hook `additionalContext` as a visible
  "hook context:" cell and ignores `suppressOutput`, so the 2KB teaching
  prompt was being shown to the user on every prompt. The static coaching
  rules now live in a marker-bounded block inside `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`,
  which Codex loads silently as ambient instructions. The per-turn hook
  emits only the small dynamic progress note.

### Internal
- New `shared/codex/agents_md.py` manages the marker block with atomic
  writes, a one-time backup on first edit, and idempotent short-circuit
  when the rendered content is unchanged.
- `build_prompt` split into `build_static_prompt` + `build_progress_note`
  so each platform can wire them up differently.
- `install_codex_plugin.py` now seeds `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` on install;
  `manage_language_coach.py remove-hook` and `off` clear the block.
