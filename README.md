## What it does

This plugin works inside **Claude Code** via a marketplace install plus a `UserPromptSubmit` hook.

Every message you send is coached **before** Claude answers your actual request:

- Writing in your target language? → Get grammar fixes + natural native-like expressions
- Writing in your native language? → Get one clean, natural target-language version
- Mixed? → Get a complete natural version of the whole meaning

The coaching core supports:

- `everyday`
- `ielts-writing`
- `ielts-speaking`
- `review`

Works for **any language pair**: Chinese → English, Japanese → English, Spanish → French, etc.

---

## Demo

Every message you send gets coached **before** Claude answers. The coaching appears in a visual box so it never blends with the actual answer.

**Everyday mode** — you write:
> "I want to know how can i to fix this bug in my code"

**Claude coaches first, then answers:**
```
╭─ 📚 English Coaching ─────────────────────
│ 原文：   "I want to know how can i to fix this bug"
│ 纠正：   "I want to know how I can fix this bug"
│ 更自然： "How do I fix this bug?" / "Can you help me debug this?"
│ 关键点： modal verb + bare infinitive — "can fix", not "can to fix"
╰────────────────────────────────────────────

(Claude's actual answer follows here)
```

**IELTS Writing mode** — you write:
> "The environment is very important and we should protect it because many reason."

**Claude coaches:**
```
╭─ 📚 English · IELTS Writing ──────────────
│ Band 估分：  5.0–5.5
│ 亮点：       主题明确，有因果逻辑意识
│ 扣分项：     "many reason" → "many reasons"；论点空洞，缺乏具体论据
│ 高分改写：   "Environmental protection is critical, as unchecked
│              pollution threatens biodiversity and public health."
│ 可复用句式： "[Topic] is critical, as [specific consequence]."
│ 练习：       用上面句式写一句关于 education 的句子
╰────────────────────────────────────────────

## Installation

### Claude Code

**Prerequisites:** `python3`

```
/plugin marketplace add leeguooooo/plugins
/plugin install language-coach@leeguooooo-plugins
/reload-plugins
/language-coach:language-coach setup
```

### Cursor

**Prerequisites:** `python3`

Install from the Cursor plugin marketplace, or add the marketplace repo directly:

1. Open **Cursor Settings → Plugins → Marketplace**
2. Add marketplace: `leeguooooo/plugins`
3. Install **language-coach**

Then run the setup command in Cursor's AI panel:

```
/language-coach setup
```

The setup wizard asks your native language, target language, goal, style, and response language — same as Claude Code — and stores config at `~/.cursor/language-coach.json`.

---

## Setup and usage

### Claude Code setup

Run `/language-coach:language-coach setup` and answer the onboarding questions:

1. What is your native language?
2. What language are you learning?
3. What is your main goal? (`everyday` / `ielts`)
4. Which coaching style? (`teaching` / `concise` / `translate`)
5. Which response language should be used after coaching? (`native` / `target`)

If you choose `ielts`, the setup flow also stores:

1. Active IELTS mode: `ielts-writing` or `ielts-speaking`
2. IELTS focus: `writing`, `speaking`, or `both`
3. Target band
4. Current level

After setup, Claude coaching activates automatically on every prompt.

---

## Modes

| Mode | What you get |
|---|---|
| `everyday` | Compact coaching with `Your original`, `Corrected`, `More natural`, and `1 key takeaway` |
| `ielts-writing` | IELTS-oriented writing feedback with band range, score-lowering issues, rewrite, reusable pattern, and drill |
| `ielts-speaking` | Spoken-naturalness feedback from text with fluency, lexical, grammar, pattern, and drill guidance |
| `review` | Compact review summary of recurring mistakes, reusable patterns, and the next drill |

## Progress tracking

Band estimates are automatically recorded to `~/.claude/language-progress.json` whenever:

1. The active mode is `ielts-writing` or `ielts-speaking`
2. The user wrote in a target language (not purely in the native language)
3. Claude gives a numeric band estimate in the coaching box

Progress is stored permanently and never deleted. Use `/language-coach:language-coach progress` to see your history:

```
English progress (last 5 sessions):
  2026-04-13  5.5
  2026-04-14  5.5
  2026-04-15  6.0
Current estimate: 6.0
```

If you also use [Claude Status Bar](https://github.com/leeguooooo/claude-code-usage-bar), the current band and trend appear automatically in the status bar (`📚 EN:6.0↑`), and the pet reacts to your coaching activity.

## Coaching styles

| Style | What it changes |
|---|---|
| `teaching` | Explanatory coaching with reasons and upgrade guidance |
| `concise` | Shorter correction-focused coaching |
| `translate` | Target-language-first coaching with minimal explanation |

---

## Configuration

Config is stored at `~/.claude/language-coach.json`. The normalized JSON schema:

```json
{
  "nativeLanguage": "Chinese",
  "targetLanguage": "English",
  "goal": "ielts",
  "mode": "ielts-writing",
  "style": "teaching",
  "responseLanguage": "target",
  "enabled": true,
  "ieltsFocus": "writing",
  "targetBand": "7.0",
  "currentLevel": "6.0",
  "version": 1
}
```

| Field | Values | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nativeLanguage` | any language name | `"Chinese"` | Your native language |
| `targetLanguage` | any language name | `"English"` | Language you are learning |
| `goal` | `everyday` / `ielts` | `"everyday"` | Top-level learning goal |
| `mode` | `everyday` / `ielts-writing` / `ielts-speaking` / `review` | `"everyday"` | Active coaching mode |
| `style` | `teaching` / `concise` / `translate` | `"teaching"` | Output verbosity |
| `responseLanguage` | `native` / `target` | `"native"` | Language used after coaching |
| `enabled` | `true` / `false` | `true` | Toggle on/off without losing config |
| `ieltsFocus` | `writing` / `speaking` / `both` | `"both"` | Stored IELTS emphasis |
| `targetBand` | free text | `""` | IELTS target band |
| `currentLevel` | free text | `""` | Current estimated level |
| `version` | integer | `1` | Schema version |

Legacy `native` / `target` keys are automatically normalized into the current schema on load.

## How it works

Both Claude Code and Cursor render the coaching context through the shared Python core:

1. `shared/config/` loads and normalizes platform config
2. `shared/pedagogy/modes.py` selects the feedback shape for the active mode
3. `shared/prompts/build_prompt.py` builds the coaching instruction text
4. `scripts/render_coaching_context.py` emits the hook JSON payload

**Claude Code** uses a `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`hooks/language-coach.sh`) — coaching fires on every prompt via `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`.

**Cursor** uses a `sessionStart` hook (`hooks/cursor-language-coach.sh`) — coaching context is injected once at session start via `additional_context`.

Both hooks exit silently — no coaching, no crash — when:

- `python3` is not installed
- The platform config file does not exist yet (`~/.claude/language-coach.json` or `~/.cursor/language-coach.json`)
- `enabled` is `false`

---

## Use cases

- **ESL learners** preparing for English-speaking job markets (Australia, UK, US, Canada)
- **Language students** who want immersive practice without leaving their dev workflow
- **Remote workers** who write in a second language every day
- **Engineers** who want to improve writing quality in technical communication

---

## Why this approach?

Most language apps are separate tools that pull you away from your work. This plugin makes every coding session a language practice session — zero context switching, zero extra effort.

---

## Manual install

### Claude Code

Clone the repo and add the hook to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash \"/path/to/prompt-language-coach/hooks/language-coach.sh\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then create `~/.claude/language-coach.json` with your config.

### Cursor

Clone the repo. Cursor picks up the plugin automatically from `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` if the repo is placed in `~/.cursor/plugins/local/language-coach`. The hook reads config from `~/.cursor/language-coach.json`.

Run setup from the Cursor AI panel:

```
/language-coach setup
```

## Real-world walkthrough

A complete example: Chinese high school student learning both English and Japanese for IELTS (target band 6.5).

### 1. Install and run setup

```
/plugin marketplace add leeguooooo/plugins
/plugin install language-coach@leeguooooo-plugins
/reload-plugins
/language-coach:language-coach setup
```

The wizard asks one question at a time:

```
What is your native language?          → Chinese
What language are you learning?        → english, japanese
What is your main goal?                → ielts
Which IELTS mode?                      → ielts-writing and ielts-speaking
Target band?                           → 6.5
Current level?                         → 高中生水平
Coaching style?                        → teaching
Response language after coaching?      → native
```

Final config stored at `~/.claude/language-coach.json`:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Native language | Chinese |
| Target languages | English + Japanese (auto-detected) |
| Goal | IELTS |
| Mode | IELTS Writing |
| Style | Teaching (detailed) |
| Response language | Chinese (native) |
| Target band | 6.5 |
| Current level | 高中生水平 |

### 2. Reload and write

```
/reload-plugins
```

From now on every message is coached automatically. The coaching box appears **before** Claude's actual answer, clearly separated.

**Writing English with a grammar error:**

User types: `"ok, It's work well."`

```
╭─ 📚 English · IELTS Writing ──────────────
│ Band 估分：  这句较短，但有语法错误
│ 亮点：       用了副词 "well" 修饰动词 ✓
│ 扣分项：     "It's work well" — it's = it is，后面不能接动词原形
│ 高分改写：   "It works well." / "It's working well."
│ 可复用句式： It + works / is working + adverb — 描述某物正常运转
│ 练习：       "The system ___ well after the update." — works 还是 is working？
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────

（Claude 的实际回答在这里，无边框）
```

**Writing Japanese** triggers the same structure with a Japanese-specific header:

```
╭─ 📚 Japanese · IELTS Writing ─────────────
│ ...
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Switch mode anytime:

```
/language-coach:language-coach mode everyday       # back to everyday coaching
/language-coach:language-coach mode ielts-writing  # back to IELTS
/language-coach:language-coach status              # show current config
```
